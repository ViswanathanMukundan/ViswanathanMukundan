Hi! I’m @ViswanathanMukundan.<br>
I’m currently an undergraduate student of Information Technology.<br>
I was interested in Machine Learning/Python programming, but then shifted towards Object-Oriented programming, and developed a further interest in Java because of it.<br>
Currently I'm aspiring to become a full-fledged product development architect, by getting involved in all the stages of development, atleast once. Development is not all about programming!
