Hi! I’m @ViswanathanMukundan.<br>
I’m currently an undergraduate student of Information Technology.<br>
I'm interested in Machine Learning/Python programming, as well as Object-Oriented programming. This led me to develop a further interest in Java.<br>
Currently I'm aspiring to become a full-fledged product development architect, by getting involved in all the stages of the product life-cycle.<br><br>

Development is not all about programming!
